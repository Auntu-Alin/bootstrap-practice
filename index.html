        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Digital Home Electronic Service has 2 sides to the user interface. It has a Public Side and the Management Panel user interface. The Public Side does not require user credentials in order to read and explore the information about the shop. The clients can also check their device service status online by simply checking it using their Repair Code. The Management Side or the Admin Panel is the side of the system where the shop's management can manage the website's information, services, clients, and more. This side requires Administrator or Staff user credentials in order to access the features and functionalities. The admin users have permission to manage all the features and functionalities of this side while the Staff has only a limited restriction. “Digital Home Electronic Service” enables repair shops to handle their everyday transactions electronically. The system can automate processes including handling repair service orders, keeping maintenance records, managing customer records and transaction records, and all other transactions that occur in a repair shop.
        Customers who need repair services usually visit a repair shop of their choosing. They go to the shop to ask about facilities, which takes a long time and is inconvenient for them. It is also difficult for repair shops to manually manage all of their transactions, especially when responding to regular customer Chatting. The manual method is inefficient and would not improve their offered customer services.</p>
